## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project is designed with scalability, maintainability, and modularity in mind, following **Clean Code Architecture (DDD)** principles. The architecture ensures separation of concerns, modularization, and testability at every layer.

### 🎨 Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design (DDD) for better scalability and modularity.
- **State Management**: Using **Bloc** to manage the app's state in a scalable way.
- **UI Components**: Fully modularized components for reusability and customization.
- **Responsiveness**: Optimized for multiple screen sizes and orientations.
- **Widgetbook**: Implemented to showcase and test individual UI components.
- **CI/CD**: Configured CI/CD pipeline with **Codemagic** for automated testing, building, and deployment.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with three main layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and domain entities (Use Cases, Repositories).
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for API calls, local storage, and data handling.
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI with **Bloc** state management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (>= 3.0)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Codemagic CI](https://codemagic.io/start/) (Optional, for CI/CD)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-app.git
   cd flutter-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📱 UI Walkthrough

### Responsive Design

This app is fully responsive and adjusts its layout for various device sizes (mobile, tablet, web). The UI components are scalable, and a **Widgetbook** is used to preview widgets in different states.

### Widgetbook Integration

To test the widgets, run:

```bash
flutter run -t lib/widgetbook.dart
```

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Setup

This project uses **Codemagic** for Continuous Integration and Delivery. The **codemagic.yaml** file is located in the root directory and contains all the necessary steps to build, test, and deploy the application automatically.

### Key features in CI/CD:

- Automated unit tests during every commit.
- Builds triggered on pull requests and merges.
- Deployment to **Google Play** / **App Store** after passing all tests.

### Running Unit Tests Locally

You can also run the tests locally before pushing to CI:

```bash
flutter test
```

---

## 🧪 Automated Unit Tests

The app has full unit test coverage for critical business logic and the use cases of the application. The `test/` directory contains all unit, widget, and integration tests.

To run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: UI framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Bloc**: State management library for scalable application architecture.
- **Widgetbook**: Component-driven UI development tool.
- **Codemagic**: CI/CD pipeline automation tool.

---

## 🤖 Continuous Integration and Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using **Codemagic**, and it automatically runs the following:

1. **Build**: Ensures the app builds on the latest Flutter SDK.
2. **Unit Tests**: Runs the automated test suite.
3. **Deployment**: Deploys the app to the Play Store/App Store (optional).
